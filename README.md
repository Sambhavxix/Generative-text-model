Description: Text Generation Model Using LSTM and GPT
This project demonstrates the development of a text generation model capable of producing coherent paragraphs on specific topics using two popular deep learning architectures: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The primary goal is to showcase how modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be leveraged to generate human-like text, which has applications in chatbots, content creation, summarization, and more.

Motivation
Text generation is a fundamental task in NLP, enabling machines to produce meaningful and contextually relevant text. With the rise of deep learning, models like LSTM and GPT have shown remarkable performance in generating text that is both fluent and context-aware. This project aims to provide a hands-on demonstration of building and using such models, making it accessible for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in AI and NLP.

Project Workflow
The project is organized as a Jupyter notebook, making it interactive and easy to follow. The workflow includes:

Importing Required Libraries:
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Hugging Face Transformers, along with utilities for data processing and visualization.

Loading and Preprocessing Data:
A sample dataset is loaded and preprocessed. The preprocessing steps include lowercasing, removing special characters, and cleaning the text to ensure high-quality input for the models.

Tokenization and Sequence Preparation:
The cleaned text is tokenized, and input sequences are prepared for training the LSTM model. This step is crucial for teaching the model the structure and flow of language.

Building and Training the LSTM Model:
An LSTM-based neural network is defined and trained on the prepared sequences. LSTM networks are well-suited for sequential data and can learn long-term dependencies, making them effective for text generation.

Using a Pre-trained GPT Model:
The notebook demonstrates how to use a pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face Transformers. GPT models are state-of-the-art in text generation and can produce highly coherent and contextually relevant paragraphs.

Generating Text Based on User Prompts:
Functions are provided to accept user prompts and generate text using both the LSTM and GPT models. This interactive feature allows users to experiment with different topics and observe the modelsâ€™ outputs.

Evaluating Generated Text:
The coherence and relevance of the generated text are evaluated, with suggestions for both human and automated assessment methods.

Deliverables
A well-documented Jupyter notebook demonstrating the entire workflow.
Example outputs from both LSTM and GPT models.
Code and explanations for each step, making it easy to understand and extend.
Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to text generation using deep learning. By combining both LSTM and GPT approaches, it highlights the strengths and differences of each method. The notebook format ensures that users can easily run, modify, and build upon the work, making it a valuable resource for learning and experimentation in NLP.
